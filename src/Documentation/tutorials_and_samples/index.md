## [Tutorial 1: Orleans Basics](tutorial_1.md)

Tutorial one guides you through the steps to create the structure and set up the packages and references of your first Orleans app.

# Samples

## What you need

The samples are self-contained, except where noted.
You might need an Azure subscription for some of the samples.
For the Azure-based samples, you will need to install the SDK.

The samples can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/tree/master/Samples).

## [Hello World](overview_helloworld.md)

An Orleans version of the classic Hello World app.
This demonstrates that while there is no such thing as "trivial" when you are dealing with distributed computing, Orleans makes it pretty straight-forward.

## [MathGrains](MathGrains.md)

This is a simple calculator that uses Orleans core components to encapsulate the functionality.

## [Adventure](Adventure.md)

Before there were graphical user interfaces, before the era of game consoles and massive-multiplayer games, there were VT100 terminals and there was [Colossal Cave Adventure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure).
Possibly lame by today's standards, back then it was a magical world of monsters, chirping birds, and things you could pick up.
It's the inspiration for this sample.
